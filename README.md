This is the Jekyll source configuration for the [OSLO² public dissemination website](http://informatievlaanderen.github.io/OSLO/).

# Building the website
The website is hosted through [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Simple edits can be made in files and GitHub will run Jekyll to create the final website. For big changes, it is advised to [locally run Jekyll (on a linux machine)](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/) to preview any changes.

    bundle exec jekyll serve
    # Navigate to http://localhost:4000/OSLO/ (final slash is needed!) 

A guide on installing jekyll for windows: [link](https://labs.sverrirs.com/jekyll/). Some [additional steps](https://milanaryal.com/jekyll-on-windows/) may be needed when encountering build errors.
